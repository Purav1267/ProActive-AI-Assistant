# tools/__init__.py
# This file marks the 'tools' directory as a Python package.
# This allows for the modules within this directory (e.g., google_calendar.py)
# to be imported elsewhere in the project using dot notation, like:
# from tools import google_calendar

# You can also use this file to make specific functions from your modules
# directly available at the package level. For example:
# from .google_calendar import check_calendar_availability
# This would allow you to import it as:
# from tools import check_calendar_availability
